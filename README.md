# test-c

So I started playing around with a little C programing for my post on the Linux gcc command, I also made a simple C program for another post on the Linux test command that was a simple custom test program example. This in turn has lead to the idea of maybe committing to writing at least twenty or so posts on basic c programing. This might just be a small collection of simple c programs and that is all then, but we will see where this goes if I go the distance with it.
